# Hello World 🌍

I did it. I finally did it.

After mass applying to 500+ companies...
After 47 rejected pull requests...
After mass debugging for mass hours...

I printed "HELLO WORLD" to the console. 🚀

But here's the thing nobody tells you about printing Hello World:

↳ It's not about the print statement.
↳ It's about the JOURNEY.
↳ It's about the MINDSET.

## What This Project Does 💡

```python
a = "HELLO"
b = "WORLD"
print(a + " " + b)
```

Yes, I used TWO variables. Because I believe in clean code. Because I believe in SCALABILITY.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- Python 🐍
- VS Code (with mass extensions)
- A mass amount of coffee ☕

## Key Learnings 📚

1. Strings can be concatenated with `+`
2. Spaces matter (added `" "` between words)
3. The `print()` function is mass powerful

## What's Next? 🔮

Tomorrow I mass deploy this to mass production.
